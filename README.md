<h1>WAHT-Based Voting Power System</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
    This smart contract implements a <strong>Voting Power System</strong> based on the concept of <strong>Weighted Average Holding Time (WAHT)</strong>. The system dynamically calculates a user’s voting power using both:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Token Balance:</strong> The number of tokens held by the user.</li>
        <li><strong>Holding Duration:</strong> The length of time for which those tokens have been held.</li>
    </ul>
    The longer tokens are held, the greater the user's accumulated holding time and, consequently, their voting power. The design optimizes gas consumption by packing balance and timestamp data into a single storage slot, making it suitable for decentralized governance systems and other gas-conscious applications.
    Unlike snapshot-based mechanisms, this approach dynamically calculates voting power in real time, avoiding the storage and computational overhead of maintaining snapshots for each voting block.
</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>
    <strong>Features:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Voting Power Calculation:</strong> Combines balance and holding duration for a fairer representation of voting power.</li>
        <li><strong>Gas Optimization:</strong> Leverages packed storage for efficient on-chain data management.</li>
        <li><strong>View-Only Voting Power Query:</strong> Provides a view-only function to compute voting power without state modification.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexible Integration:</strong> Suitable for DAOs and decentralized governance models.</li>
        <li><strong>Snapshot-Free Mechanism:</strong> Eliminates reliance on snapshot-based methods, reducing overhead.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>How It Works:</strong>
    <h3>Core Concept</h3>
    The contract tracks token balances and calculates a <strong>Weighted Average Holding Time (WAHT)</strong> using the following components:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Token Balance (B):</strong> The number of tokens held by a user.</li>
        <li><strong>Holding Time (T):</strong> The duration for which tokens are held.</li>
    </ul>
    A user’s total holding time is incremented based on their balance and how long it has been since the last update. This accumulated time contributes to their voting power.
    
    <h3>Storage Optimization</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Packed Data Format:</strong> The contract stores user balances and timestamps in a single 256-bit slot:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>128 bits:</strong> Token balance.</li>
                <li><strong>64 bits:</strong> Last update timestamp.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Functions:</strong>
    <h3>updateWAHT</h3>
    <pre><code>
function updateWAHT(address account, uint256 newBalance) external
Purpose: Updates the Weighted Average Holding Time (WAHT) for a user whenever their balance changes (e.g., transfer, mint, burn).
Parameters:
    account: Address of the user whose WAHT is being updated.
    newBalance: The updated token balance for the user.
Logic:
    Calculates the time elapsed since the last update.
    Updates the user’s total holding time based on their balance and elapsed time.
    Packs the new balance and timestamp into storage.
    </code></pre>
    
    <h3>getVotingPower</h3>
    <pre><code>
function getVotingPower(address account) external view returns (uint256)
Purpose: Calculates the current voting power for a user.
Parameters:
    account: Address of the user whose voting power is being queried.
Returns:
    Voting power based on the user’s accumulated holding time and balance.
Logic:
    Retrieves the user’s balance and last update timestamp from packed data.
    Computes additional holding time since the last update.
    Normalizes the result for consistent scaling.
    </code></pre>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Example Integration with ERC-20:</strong>
    <p>The Weighted Average Holding Time (WAHT) concept is designed to integrate seamlessly into ERC-20 tokens. Below is an example implementation showcasing how this can be directly integrated into the <code>_transfer</code> function of an ERC-20 contract.</p>
    
    <h3>Example ERC-20 Token: exampleERC20Token</h3>
    <pre><code>
contract exampleERC20Token is IERC20 {
    VotingPower public votingPowerContract;

    constructor(address votingPowerAddress) {
        votingPowerContract = VotingPower(votingPowerAddress);
    }

    function _transfer(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) internal {
        require(sender != address(0), "Transfer from the zero address");
        require(recipient != address(0), "Transfer to the zero address");

        _balances[sender] -= amount;
        _balances[recipient] += amount;

        // Update WAHT balances in VotingPower contract
        votingPowerContract.updateWAHT(sender, _balances[sender]);
        votingPowerContract.updateWAHT(recipient, _balances[recipient]);

        emit Transfer(sender, recipient, amount);
    }
}
    </code></pre>
    
    <p><strong>Key Points of Integration:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Updates:</strong> Each transfer automatically updates the Weighted Average Holding Time for both the sender and the recipient.</li>
        <li><strong>Gas Efficiency:</strong> The integration ensures minimal additional gas costs by using packed storage and efficient function calls.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Voting Power Adjustments:</strong> Voting power remains up-to-date after every transfer.</li>
        <li><strong>Snapshot-Free Distribution:</strong> This mechanism dynamically adjusts voting power without the need for maintaining historical snapshots.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
